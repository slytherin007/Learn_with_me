# 🌟🛑 Day 4: Wrestling with Widget Alignment 🛑🌟

---

Today, I set out to create a login and sign-in page for my app. But guess what? The widgets just wouldn't stay in line! No matter how hard I tried, they refused to sit neatly where I wanted them. 🤷‍♂️

I thought it'd be easy—putting boxes for usernames, passwords, and buttons in a row. But oh boy, it turned into a real puzzle. Each time I moved something, it seemed like everything else wanted to go in a different direction! 🧩

Aligning these little pieces perfectly became a big headache. I realized that even the tiniest misplacement messed up how the login page looked and worked. 🤦‍♀️

Despite the struggle, I'm learning a lot. Figuring out how to make these widgets play nice together is teaching me a ton about how Flutter arranges stuff on the screen. 📱💡

So, Day 4 ended with a bunch of widgets out of place, but it's all part of the journey. I'm determined to crack this and create a login page that's smooth and easy for everyone to use. 💪

Stay tuned to see how I tackle this widget puzzle in Flutter! 🚀
